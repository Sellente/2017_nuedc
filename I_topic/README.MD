### Topic review
In this topic there will be a cubic space [80*80*80(cm^3)]. Now place 3 LED on its top surface internally. We need to move a sensor on bottom suface and display sensor's position(positioning error < 3cm). In addition, the 3 LED could transmit 3 audio signal.

### This solution is using Raspberry and Camera OV5647 to positioning.
